      "abstract": "Ada was designed from the beginning specifically for reliability and maintainability. The simple use of the Ada language can eliminate some of the most common software vulnerabilities. In the SHUA series, we use real examples to demonstrate why chosing Ada for your projects makes more sense than ever.",

      "abstract": "Recently, a serious vulnerability (CVE-2018-19788) appeared in the popular polkit authentication D-Bus service used on many Linux platforms, especially those running systemd. In this post we explore the root cause and focus on why Ada's type system would have prevented this kind of (common) flaw from ever arising in the first-place.",

That structural discipline, which has always been a core design feature of Ada, is both unique and essential to Ada's aptitude for readability, maintainability, agility, and dramatically reduced testing requirements.",
