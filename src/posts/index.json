      "abstract": "The Should Have Used Ada (SHUA) series selects examples from the daily stream of vulnerabilities in common software, which are often due to the convolution of human error and programmer-biased language design. Ada's design, similar to double-entry accounting, applies technology to reduce the impact of our inherent weaknesses as humans. In this post, we look at how Ada could have prevented the infamous Goto fail vulnerability.",
